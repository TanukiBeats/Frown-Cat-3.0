Main Weekly Meeting

Present: Miwako Ito, Jeff Montano, Max Steiner

- "Homework" section added to Gantt chart specifically for milestones given by Chad which are graded.
- Gantt chart completed to turn in this upcoming Wednesday. May be updated later on.
- Individual literature reviews for technology options.
- Economic analyses tied to due dates for Level 1 and Level 2 simulations. 
- Setting personal due date for final report as two days before class due date. 

Literature Review Exchange
1. Miwako - Presure-Swing Adsorption (nitrogen production)
2. Jeff - Alkaline (hydrogen production)
3. Max - Reactive Adsorption (ammonia production)

Notes:
- Jeff needs to figure out how to model his process in ASPEN since it includes an ionic reaction. 
- Max needs to consider how many reactors to use and what size they will be. Two half-size reactors working full time or two full-size reactors working half-time?
- We all need to consider how the oxygen could possibly be integrated as a fuel source for the reactor.
- General heat intgration for the reactive step.

Questions:
- For the economic analysis are we selling the ammonia or using it ourselves for production of something else?
- Can we use experimental results for a fixed stoichiometric yield (or time-based) rather than kinetics in ASPEN?
